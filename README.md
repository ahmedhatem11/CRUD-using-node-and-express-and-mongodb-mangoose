It is a simple experss node app for create update delete an getting data 

The project is divided to two models and two controllers main folders are (models, controllers).

* models : where is the mangoose schema.
* controllers : Is where i do my crud functions .

To run the project:


Make sure you have these installed just run npm install
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - express.js
  - mongodb and it should be running.

I advice you to use post man for testing.
